## Learning Log

#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: 1/17/2026 - 1/26/2026

**What I learned this week:**
- I learned about what makes Gemini/Google AI, Claude and ChatGPT different from one another
- I didn't make any discoveries regarding rate limiting because I didn't run into any rate limits during my prompts 

**What challenged me:**
- Creating the issue and folder/files in Github + understanding the way text works in Github was a new challenge for me

**What I'm proud of:**
- I'm proud of completing H.1.1 to the best of my ability

**Questions I still have:**
- My current question is if I'm putting this learning log in the correct README -- was it meant to go in the main profile README or inside of the week-02-sage README
