# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
SAGE stands for Study Assistant and Guide Engine. A personalized AI learning companion stored in Github. This workspace helps document my journey in this course.

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
Some possibilities I can imagine for SAGE being helpful throughout the semester include:
Tracking my progress through the course
Tracking my experiences with AI, including problems I may run into
Documenting my comparisons of different AI tools 
Helping me getting initiated with Github and being my first official use of features on Github


## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: ChatGPT - I chose this as my favorite AI tool -- but as I'm using the Kevin-bot on Google AI studio I'm really enjoying it's assistance 
- **Secondary**: Google AI Studio - I might use this instead of my primary if I would like to utilize the specific "Kevin" personality for now
- **For Special Tasks**: Claude - If I would like to interact with a more relaxed and less robotic AI

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
[Write 3-5 personal guidelines for when/how you'll use AI ethically and effectively]
For efficacy I make sure to always carefully explain my question/circumstances to the AI I'm using as this produces the most helpful and accurate results
For ethical purposes I make sure to never use AI in place of critical thinking -- I only use AI for practical and appropriate purposes inside and outside of college, such as helping explain HOW to work through a problem rather than answering the problem for me
A third personal guideline I tend to automatically follow is interacting with the AI with a normal amount of respect in my typing -- this might sound silly but I don't speak to the AI in a rude manner because I just find it to be negative even though the AI doesn't care either way
