## Test Results

### Prompt 1: Simple Explanation Task
**Prompt**: Explain what artificial intelligence is to someone who has never heard of it before. Keep it under 100 words.

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | 7.0s | Okay | Suitable compact answer but doesn't stand out or make me feel like I have a great understanding from reading it |
| Claude | 5.6s | Good | This response went into a bit more detail but I would've appreciated it mentioning more about how AI "thinks" and how it uses pattern recognition based on it's training |
| ChatGPT | 3.0s | Good | Same notes as Claude |

### Prompt 2: Haiku (I had to try to understand how to determine quality of haikus for this one)
**Prompt**: Write a haiku about debugging code at 2 AM.

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | 10.2s | Good | No notes |
| Claude | 3.9s | Excellent | No notes |
| ChatGPT | 1.6s | Good/Excellent | I liked the part 'dawn waits unimpressed' |

### Prompt 3: Differences between ML and programming
**Prompt**: List 5 key differences between machine learning and traditional programming. Format as a comparison table.

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | 4.4s | Excellent | Succinct and easy to understand |
| Claude | 9.0s | Okay | Less straightforward but still descriptive |
| ChatGPT | 4.5s | Good | Clean and accurate |

### Prompt 4: 30-day learning plan for Github
**Prompt**: I need to learn GitHub for a college course. Create a 30-day learning plan with specific daily tasks. Keep each day under 30 minutes of work.

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | 14.2s | Good | To-the-point without extra filler, it says it follows "Github Flow -- standard way professionals collaborate on code" |
| Claude | 33.0s | Good | It put the 30-day schedule into an "artifact" in the chat, it included some encouraging messages and tips |
| ChatGPT | 13.0s | Good | Straightforward 30-day plan |

## Formatting
**Google AI Studio**

The output is well-structured but I don't really like how the website looks, I also had "grounding with Google search" enabled while doing the prompts so I didn't really like seeing the search suggestions beneath each prompt but that is my own fault.

**Claude**

Similar to Gemini -- the output itself is put together nicely I just don't like the website layout in particular.

**ChatGPT**

ChatGPT has my favorite formatting out of the 3 because it is the most minimalistic with well-structured output and the most optimal UI and user experience in my opinion.

## Unexpected Behavior

The only unexpected behavior I ran into was Gemini listing the sources it uses (most of my interactions with AI haven't included this although it can be useful, it was unexpected) and Claude saving the schedule into an artifact -- I've never seen this in an AI chat. Neither of these are negatives they are just new to me. 

## My Choice for Primary Tool

**Tool**: ChatGPT 

**Reasoning**: I would choose this tool because it is most comfortable to me and I find it to be productive and easy to interact with.   

**Backup Plan**: I would use Google AI as a backup utilizing the Kevin personality chat for technical/coursework questions, or Claude for a more friendly conversation. 

## Tool Comparison Conclusion

I hadn't used Gemini, Google AI Studio or Claude before this assignment so I had to try to understand better what differentiates them from other AI such as ChatGPT, what I learned is that Google Studio is optimal for people who heavily rely on other Google apps or features because of Google AI's ability to work across other Google services, so I would consider using Google Studio for tasks if I needed to also utilize other Google services alongside it. I might consider using Claude for it's more friendly chat-style. But overall I would default to ChatGPT as I favor more succinct answers with the minimal UI.
